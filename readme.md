This lab introduces the use of pointers with functions, passing
by reference, and using enumerated types for error handling.  It
also introduces formal unit testing using the cmocka unit test
framework.

## Prior to Lab

* Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
* Read the required chapters(s) of the textbook as
  outlined in the course schedule.

## Peer Programming Pair-Up

***For students in online section(s):*** you may complete
the lab on your own if you wish or you may team up with a partner
of your choosing, or, you may consult with a lab instructor to get
teamed up online (via Zoom).

***For students in the on campus section:*** your lab instructor
may team you up with a partner.  

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other
the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is "in charge."  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week,
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

# Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following

-   Basics of enumerated types

-   Functions with pass-by-value and pass-by-reference parameters

-   How to design and use functions with error handling

-   Have exposure to a formal unit testing framework

# Background

## Enumerated Types

*Enumerated types* are data types that define a set of named values.
Enumerated types are often ordered and internally associated with
integers (starting with `0` by default and incremented by one in the order
of the list). The purpose of enumerated types is to organize certain
types and enforce specific values. Without enumerated types, integer
values must be used and the convention of assigning certain integer
values to certain types in a logical collection must be remembered or
documentation referred to as needed. Enumerated types provide a
human-readable "tag" to these types of elements, relieving the
programmer of continually having to refer to the convention and avoiding
errors.

## Passing by Value versus Passing by Reference

In general there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a
function: by value or by reference. When an argument (a variable) is
passed by value to a function, a copy of the value stored in the
variable is placed on the program stack and the function uses this
copy's value during its execution. Any changes to the copy are not
realized in the calling function, but are local to the function.

In contrast, when an argument (variable) is passed by reference to a
function, the variable's memory address is used. Locally (that is,
*inside the function*), the variable is treated as a pointer; to get or
set its value, it must be dereferenced using the `*` operator. Any
changes to the memory cell pointed to by that pointer are reflected
globally in the program and more specifically, in the calling function.

A full example:

```c
//a regular variable:
int a = 10;

//a pointer to an integer, initially pointing to NULL
int *ptr = NULL;

// & is the referencing operator, it gets the memory
// address of the variable a so that ptr can point to it
ptr = &a;

// The star: * is the dereferencing operator.  It changes
// the pointer back into a regular variable so a value can
// accessed or assigned:
*ptr = 20; //a now holds the value 20
```

One of the main uses of pointers is to enable pass-by-reference for
functions. Consider the following function:

```c
int foo(int a, int b) {
  a = 10;
  return a + b;
}
```

When we call `foo`, the variable's we pass to it are *passed by value*
meaning that the value stored in the variables at the time that
we call the function are copied and given to the function. The change to
the variable `a` in line 2 *only affects the local variable*. The
original variable is unaltered. That is, the following code:

```c
int x = 5;
int y = 20;
int z = foo(x, y);
printf("x, y, z = %d, %d, %d\n" x, y, z);
```

would print `5, 20, 30`: the variable `x` is not changed by
the function `foo`. Contrast this with the following:

```c
int bar(int *a, int b) {
  *a = 10;
  return (*a) + b;
}
```

In the function `bar`, the variable `a` is passed *by reference*
using a pointer. Since the memory address is passed to `bar` instead
of a copy of a value, we can alter the original value. Now when line 2
changes the value of the pointer `a`, the change affects the
original variable. That is, the code

```c
int x = 5;
int y = 20;
int z = foo(&x, y);
printf("x, y, z = %d, %d, %d\n" x, y, z);
```

Will now print `10, 20, 30` since the variable `x` was passed
by reference.

Passing by reference also allows us to design functions that can compute
multiple values and "return" them in pass-by-reference pointer
variables. This frees up the return value to be used as an error code
that can be communicated back to the calling function in the event of an
error or bad input values.

## (Re)designing Your Functions

In the previous lab you designed several functions to convert RGB values
to gray-scale (using one of three techniques) and to sepia. The details
of how to do this available in the previous lab and are repeated for
your convenience below.

The design of those functions was less than ideal. For the gray scale
functions, there was a function for each of the three techniques. For
the sepia conversion, we had to have three separate functions (one for
each component, red, green, blue). This was necessary because functions
can only return one value. We can't have a function compute and "return"
all three RGB values. However, if we use pass-by-reference variables, we
*can* compute and "return" multiple values with a single function!
Moreover, we can then use the actual return value to indicate an error
with the inputs (if any).

Redesign your functions from the previous lab as follows. For the gray
scale functionality, implement a single function with the following
signature:

`int toGrayScale(int *r, int *g, int *b, Mode m)`

The function takes three integer values by reference and will use the
value stored in them to compute a gray scale RGB value. It will then
store the result *back* into the variables.

To specify which of the three *modes* is to be used, we have defined an
enumerated type in the `colorUtils.h` header file:

```c
typedef enum {
  AVERAGE,
  LIGHTNESS,
  LUMINOSITY
} Mode;
```

Finally, identify any and all error conditions and use the return value
to indicate an error code (0 for no error, non-zero value(s) for error
conditions). You should define another enumerated type to represent
error codes.

For the sepia filter, implement a single function with the following
signature:

`int toSepia(int *r, int *g, int *b);`

The function should use the values stored in the variables passed by
reference and then store the results in them. Again, error codes should
be returned for invalid input values and you should use the enumerated
type you defined for error codes.

Finally, add proper documentation to your functions' prototypes.

## Running Unit Tests

As with the previous lab, you can test your functions using the full
image driver program. To build the project use `make` and run the
executable `imageDriver`, testing it on a few images of your
choice (a few have been included in the project. This is essentially an
*ad-hoc test* which is not very rigorous nor reliable and is a manual
process.

In the last lab you wrote several *informal* unit tests. Writing unit
tests automates the testing process and is far more rigorous. However,
this involved writing a lot of boilerplate code to run the tests, print
out the results and keep track of the number passed/failed.

In practice, it is better to use a more formal unit testing framework or
library. There are several such libraries for C, but one that we'll use
is cmocka (<https://cmocka.org/>). First, you'll need to make sure that
cmocka is installed in your IDE.  Run the following commands:

`sudo apt update`

then:

`sudo apt-get install libcmocka-dev libcmocka0 cmocka-doc`

to install cmocka.  We have provided unit testing code in
a file, `colorUtilsTesterCmocka.c` that implements and runs a
*suite* of unit tests. You can build this testing suite using :

`make colorUtilsTesterCmocka`

and run the resulting executable:

`./colorUtilsTesterCmocka`

This starter file should be sufficient to demonstrate how to use cmocka,
but the full documentation can be found here: <https://api.cmocka.org/>.

Run the test suite and verify that your code passes *all* the tests. Fix
any issues or bugs that become apparent as a result of this testing.
Passing 100% of the provided test cases will suffice to complete the
lab. However, we *highly encourage* you to read the cmocka test file to
understand how the tests are setup and performed and then try to add
at least a few of your own test case.

# Color Formulas

To convert an RGB value to gray-scale you can use one of several
different techniques. Each technique "removes" the color value by
setting all three RGB values to the same value but each technique does
so in a slightly different way.

The first technique is to simply take the average of all three values:

$$\frac{r + g + b}{3}$$

The second technique, known as the "lightness" technique averages the
most prominent and least prominent colors:

$$\frac{\max \left\\{r, g, b\right\\} + \min\\{r, g, b\\}}{2}$$

The luminosity technique uses a weighted average to account for a human
perceptual preference toward green, setting all three values to:
$0.21 r + 0.72 g + 0.07 b$ In all three cases, the integer values
should be *rounded* rather than truncated.

A sepia filter sets different values to each of the three RGB components
using the following formulas. Given a current $(r,g,b)$ value, the sepia
tone RGB value, $(r',g',b')$ would be:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
  r' &= 0.393r + 0.769g + 0.189b \\
  g' &= 0.349r + 0.686g + 0.168b \\
  b' &= 0.272r + 0.534g + 0.131b
\end{array}$$

As with the gray-scale techniques, values should be
rounded. If any of the resulting RGB values exceeds 255, they should be
reset to the maximum, 255.

# Handin/Grader Instructions

1.  Hand in your completed files:

    -   `colorUtils.c`

    -   `colorUtils.h`

    -   `colorUtilsTesterCmocka.c`

    Be sure your program passes all tests to get credit.

2.  Even if you worked with a partner, you *both* should turn in all
    files.


# Advanced Activity (Optional)

Cmocka is only one of many possible unit testing frameworks available
for C. Another example is Google Test
(<https://github.com/google/googletest>). Read the following tutorial
<http://notes.eatonphil.com/unit-testing-c-code-with-gtest.html> and
rewrite the cmocka unit tests using Google Test's framework/library
instead in order to get exposure to how different unit testing libraries
are designed.
